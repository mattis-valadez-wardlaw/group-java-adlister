## Project Planning
For this project, we utilized a Kanban Board to stay organized. We created a list of tasks and organized them into multiple columns. Because of this, we were easily able to assign ownership and track progress through various phases of development. Our go-to project planning resource was Trello.

Check out our team Trello Board [HERE](https://trello.com/b/oPYStSsT/s-o-j-u-board).
